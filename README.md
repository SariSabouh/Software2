No need for Dr. Thornton Repo.
See if SOAP if easier and we will need it.
Main task is to access GB from outside the block. Within the block you have restricted permissions,
so with the proxy tool we need to have more access to the GB with no restrictions. WE NEED TO MAKE THE PROXY TOOL SPEAK!
Shared Secret: it is possibly a code that will allow the Proxy Tool to be a "Teacher" to be able to edit information.


Notes about Web Services:
XML is used to tag the data, SOAP is used to transfer the data, WSDL is used for describing the services available and UDDI is used for listing what services are available
Web services allow organizations to communicate data without intimate knowledge of each other's IT systems behind the firewall.
SOAP is used to code and decode requests and responses before they are sent over a network. It is independent of any operating system
WSDL is an XML-Formatted language used to describe the capabilities of the Web Service as communication end points capable of exchanging messages 
UDDI is basically the Internets phone book of yellow and white pages.
Web services extend the World Wide Web infrastructure to provide the means for software to connect to other software applications.
Applications access Web services via ubiquitous Web protocols and data formats such as HTTP, XML, and SOAP, with no need to worry about how each Web service is implemented
Web services combine the best aspects of component-based development and the Web, and are a cornerstone of the Microsoft .NET programming model.
